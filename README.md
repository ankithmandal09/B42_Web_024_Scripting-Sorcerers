## Design Decisions & Assumptions
The Reebok Clone is a frontend-based website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the look and feel of Reebok's official website. The design focuses on a clean and responsive UI, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices. JavaScript is used for interactive elements such as navigation menus, product filtering, and basic cart functionality.  

This project helps in understanding UI design, styling, and DOM manipulation to create a visually appealing e-commerce platform.
